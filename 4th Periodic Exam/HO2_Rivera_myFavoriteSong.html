	[Verse 1] <br>
I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me when we're alone
<br>
You can hold my hand if no one's home
<br>
Do you like it when I'm away?
<br>
If I went and hurt my body, baby, would you love me the same?
<br>
I can feel all my bones coming back and I'm craving motion
<br>
Mama never really learned how to live by herself
<br>
It's a curse and it's growing
<br>
You're a pond and I'm an ocean, oh
<br>
All my emotions feel like explosions when you are around
<br>
And I've found a way to kill the sound, oh <h2>


<P> <h2> <p style="font-family:Script MT;color:white;font-size:40px">
[Chorus]<br>
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
<br>
I need you here to stay
<br>
I broke all my bones that day I found you
<br>
Crying at the lake
<br>
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
<br>
Oh, and if I could take it all back
<br>
I swear that I would pull you from the tide

<br>

<P> <h2> <p style="font-family:Script MT;color:white;font-size:40px">
[Verse 2]<br>
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
<br>
I said no (I said no), I said no (I said no)
<br>
Listen close, it's a no
<br>
The wind is a-pounding on my back
<br>
And I've found hope in a heart attack
<br>
Oh, at last, it is past
<br>
Now I've got it, and you can't have it

<br>

<P> <h2> <p style="font-family:Script MT;color:white;font-size:40px">
[Chorus]<br>
Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
<br>
I need you here to stay
<br>
I broke all my bones that day I found you
<br>
Crying at the lake
<br>
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
<br>
Oh, and if I could take it all back
<br>
I swear that I would pull you from the tide

<P> <h2> <p style="font-family:Script MT;color:white;font-size:40px">
[Bridge] <br>
Darling, when I'm fast asleep
<br>
I've seen this person watching me
<br>
Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"
<br>
Oh-oh

<br>

<P> <h2> <p style="font-family:Script MT;color:white;font-size:40px">
[Post-Bridge]<br>
Because there is something and there is nothing
<br>
There is nothing in-between
<br>
And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer watching over me
<br>
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
<br>
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without aâ€”"

<br>

<P> <h2> <p style="font-family:Script MT;color:white;font-size:40px">
[Chorus] <br>
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
<br>
I need you here to stay
<br>
Broke all my bones that day I found you
<br>
Crying at the lake
<br>
Oh, was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
<br>
Oh, and if I could take it all back

I swear that I would pull you from the tide </h2>
